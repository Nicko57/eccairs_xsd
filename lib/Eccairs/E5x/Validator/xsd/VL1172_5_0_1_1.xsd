EUROCONTROL Note: ATM related major incidents would include more specifically near collisions between aircraft, near collisions between aircraft and obstacles, near Controlled Flight Into Terrain.

EUROCONTROL Note: ATM related significant incidents would include more specifically situations where collisions/near collisions could have occurred in other conditions.
