          <xs:documentation source="explanation">Rain is precipitation in the form of water droplets making a noticeable impact. Ranges in size from 1 to 5.5 mm.

Rain shower: Liquid precipitation that stops and starts  suddenly and varies widely in intensity, and is gone in less than an hour.

Freezing rain is the precipitation of supercooled raindrops.Freezing rain freezes on impact and forms a coat of ice on the ground and on the objects they strike. They occur when the air temperature is below zero Celsius near the ground but above zero Celsius higher up.</xs:documentation>

          <xs:documentation source="explanation">Fairly uniform precipitation (rain) composed exclusively of very small water droplets (less than 0.5 mm in diameter) very close to one another.

In drizzle, the water droplets are fine and minute--much smaller than in rain--and appear to float in the air.

Freezing drizzle is the precipitation of supercooled raindrops.Freezing drizzle freezes on impact and forms a coat of ice on the ground and on the objects they strike. They occur when the air temperature is below zero Celsius near the ground but above zero Celsius higher up.</xs:documentation>

          <xs:documentation source="description">Precipitations - Snow</xs:documentation>
          <xs:documentation source="detailedDescription">The precipitation type was snow (SN).</xs:documentation>
          <xs:documentation source="explanation">Snow is precipitation in the form of feathery ice crystals or large agglomerations in the form of flakes. Snow is composed of millions of star-shaped hexagonal ice crystals. 

When the term snow is used without qualification, it means precipitation of significant duration and extent. A flurry or snow shower is a snowfall that suddenly stops and starts and changes rapidly in intensity; the accumulation and extent of the snow are limited. A snow squall brings strong winds, flurries and poor visibility.

Blowing snow is lifted by the wind from the earth's surface to a height of 2 m or more, whereas drifting snow is blown to a height of less than 2 m. A blizzard is a severe storm that lasts three or more hours, and brings low temperatures, strong winds and poor visibility due to blowing snow.

Snow shower: Frozen precipitation in the form of snow, characterized by its sudden beginning and ending. It is reported as "SHSN" in an observation and on the METAR.</xs:documentation>

          <xs:documentation source="explanation">Hail is precipitation in the form of lumps of ice, larger than ice pellets, usually the size of peas or cherries but sometimes as large as oranges. Often associated with thunderstorms, hail forms when drafts carry raindrops upward into extremely cold regions of the atmosphere. There, the drops freeze and merge into lumps of ice. When the lumps become too heavy to be supported by the updraft, they fall to the ground at high speeds. </xs:documentation>

          <xs:documentation source="detailedDescription">The weather phenomenon present was a tornado or waterspout (+FC).</xs:documentation>
          <xs:documentation source="explanation">A tornado is a localized violent wind with such low pressure in the core as to explode structures in its path. The tornado is usually pendant beneath a cumulonimbus cloud. A tornado appears as a violent funnel-shaped wind vortex in the lower atmosphere with upward spiralling winds of high speeds. The tornado usually appears from a bulge in the base of a thunderstorm cloud. It has a typical width of tens to hundreds of metres and a lifespan of minutes to hours. In extent, it is one of the smallest of all storms, but in violence, it is among the world's most severe.

Waterspout: A violently rotating column of air, usually a pendant to a cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud, over a body of water with its circulation reaching the water. In the summer and spring, these phenomena are usually "tornadoes over water" that have been generated by thunderstorms. In the fall months, these most often begin as "cold air funnels", being generated by a cold air mass passing over much warmer waters. Such waterspouts are generally much less intense than tornadoes and usually dissipate upon approaching shore. Waterspouts are most common over tropical or subtropical waters. The exact definition of waterspout is debatable. In most cases the term is reserved for small vortices over water that are not associated with storm-scale rotation (i.e., they are the water-based equivalent of landspouts). But there is sufficient justification for calling virtually any rotating column of air a waterspout if it is in contact with a water surface. </xs:documentation>
