          <xs:documentation source="explanation"> An occurrence associated with the sudden and partial inability to provide ATM Services in compliance with applicable safety regulatory requirements. Example: Inability to maintain a safe ATM service within one or more airspace sectors without warning and for a significant period of time. The ATCO's workload increased significantly and he was provided with less information than required for normal operations. Limitations to ATM services were imposed and/or contingency Separation Measures weer applied to compensate for the loss or corrupted function(s) but the risk of infringing safe separation was high and multiple losses of separation did/could have occurred until traffic levels were reduced.</xs:documentation>

Example: Sudden inability to provide any degree of safe ATM service within several airspace sectors without warning and for a significant period of time. No contingency measure could be applied. ATCO loosing totally its ability to control the situation. Situation has every chance to lead to many accidents/serious incidents</xs:documentation>
