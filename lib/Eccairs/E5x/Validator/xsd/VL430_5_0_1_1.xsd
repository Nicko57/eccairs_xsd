          <xs:documentation source="explanation">Usage Notes: Occurrences do not necessarily involve an aircraft. 

Includes:

o Runways and Taxiways 
o Buildings and structures 
o Crash/Fire/Rescue (CFR) services 
o Obstacles on the Aerodrome property 
o Lighting, markings, and signage 
o Procedures, policies, and standards 
- Deficiencies with snow, frost, or ice removal from aerodrome surfaces 
- Closed runways, improperly marked runways, construction interference, lighting failures, signage limitations, etc.

          <xs:documentation source="explanation">Usage Notes:
• This category includes the intentional maneuvering of the aircraft to avoid a collision with terrain, objects/obstacles, weather or other aircraft (Note: The effect of intentional maneuvering is the key consideration).
• Abrupt maneuvering may also result in a loss of control or system/component failure or malfunction. In this case, the event is coded under both categories (e.g., AMAN and Loss of Control–Inflight (LOC–I), AMAN and System/Component Failure or Malfunction (Non- Powerplant) (SCF–NP), or AMAN and System/Component Failure or Malfunction
(Powerplant) (SCF–PP)).
• Abrupt maneuvering may also occur on ground; examples include hard braking maneuver, rapid change of direction to avoid collisions, etc.

- Contamination: Any foreign substance (for example: water, oil, ice, dirt, sand, bugs) in the correct type of fuel for the given powerplant(s).

          <xs:documentation source="explanation">Loss of control inflight is an extreme manifestation of a deviation from intended flightpath. The phrase “loss of control” may cover only some of the cases during which an unintended deviation occurred.

Community comments:  It is  suggested that the occurrence title is reviewed and changed accordingly. For example: Deviation from Intended Flightpath- DEV.

Usage Notes:
• Used only for airborne phases of flight in which aircraft control was lost.
• Loss of control can occur during either Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) or Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC).
• The loss of control during flight may occur as a result of a deliberate maneuver (e.g., stall/spin practice).
• Occurrences involving configuring the aircraft (e.g., flaps, slats, onboard systems, etc.) are included as well as rotorcraft retreating blade stall.
• Stalls are considered loss of control and are included here.
• Rotorcraft occurrences which involve power settling (vortex ring), or settling with power to ground contact are coded here and as Abnormal Runway Contact (ARC) if during normal landing or takeoff.
• Rotorcraft External Load operations involving loss of control related to the external load should be coded as LOC–I as well as External Load Related Occurrences (EXTL).
• Includes Rotorcraft “Loss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness.”
• Includes loss of control during practice or emergency autorotation.
• Includes pilot-induced or assisted oscillations.
• For unmanned aircraft events, includes hazardous outcomes involving deviation from intended flightpath associated with anticipated or unanticipated loss of datalink. However, if loss of datalink is the direct result of a system/component failure or malfunction, code the occurrence as System/Component Failure or Malfunction (Non-Powerplant) (SCF–NP) only. 
• For icing-related events, which are also loss of control, code both LOC–I and Icing (ICE)).
• If the loss of control is a direct result of a system/component failure or malfunction (SCF), code the occurrence as an System/Component Failure or Malfunction (Non-Powerplant) (SCF–NP), or System/Component Failure or Malfunction (Powerplant) (SCF–PP) only. However, loss of control may follow less severe system/component failures, and in this case, code both categories.
• Cockpit crew vision-related events and flight in degraded visual environments (for example, obscuration, black hole approach events, brownouts, or whiteout events), in which the aircraft is flown under control into terrain, water, or obstacles, are coded under Controlled Flight Into or Toward Terrain (CFIT), not LOC–I.
